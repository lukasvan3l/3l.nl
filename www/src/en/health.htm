<table width=100%><tr><td>
The SRC seeks to improve the health of the rural-youth by preventing sickness. Below you will find some more information about the techniques used to achieve this goal.

<br>&nbsp<p class=head2><u><b>Water filtering</b></u></p>
There is a plan to filter the water better so it will be drinkable.

<br>&nbsp<p class=head2><B><u>Urinal</u></b></p>
Sekyere momentarily does not have an adequate urinal. The SRC is building a new urinal.

<br>&nbsp<p class=head2><B><u>Immunity shots</u></b></p>
Immunity-days are held against many types of sicknesses (ie Polio and Measels).

<br>&nbsp<p class=head2><B><u>Education</u></b></p>
Research has shown that the rural adolescent does not receive enough education on their health and how to stay healthy.<br>They learn about foods, sicknesses and how to attend sick people. Special attention is given to STD's including HIV/AIDS.

<br>&nbsp<p class=head2><B><u>Mobile clinics</u></b></p>
Next to preventing sicknesses, the SRC also operates mobile clinics in the target communities.
