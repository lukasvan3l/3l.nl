<p class=head2><u><B>SRC Strategic Objectives</b></u></p>
<b>Health</b><br>
Research has shown that the rural adolescent has the unmet needs with regard to information and education on their reproductive health. This has resulted in high occurrences of teenage pregnancy STD'S including HIV/AIDS. We seek therefore to ensure adequate provision of education on reproductive health issue to the Rural-Youth in rural communities. The sound mind of the Rural-Youth is possible only in the sound body; hence we operate mobile clinics in the target communities.
<p><b>Water</b><br>
Most of the rural communities do not have access to safe drinking water. They rely mainly on rivers and streams, which are infested with guinea worms resulting in serious health consequences.  Therefore, we aim at facilitating the provision of bore-holes and wells in the rural communities.
<p><b>School</b><br>We believe that the welfare community is directly linked with the well being and development of the girl-child, who is the future mother.
We therefore seek to:<ul>
<li>Establish basic schools from nursery up to the Junior Secondary School Level</li>
<li>Encourage mothers and mobilize girls for enrolment, offering support where necessary to the needy girls</li>
<li>Recruit and mobilize teenage mothers and people with disabilities for skills training and employment in agro -processing.</li></ul>
<p><b>Agriculture</b><br>Malnutrition is a key feature manifesting in the poor health of the rural women in Ghana. Although, the men produce highly nutritious local foods such as vegetables, legumes and fruits, they rather sell the produce for money than eat them. We intend to involve rural women in crops and animal farming as a means of empowering women, especially teenage mothers for quality living.
<p><b>Advocacy</b><br>We seek to sensitize, create awareness and wage sustainable crusade in the rural communities against all cultural and religious practices that hamper the sound development of the rural youth, especially the women.
The areas that look at include:<ul>
<li>Child labor</li>
<LI>Violence against rural women (female circumcision, widowhood rites, gender gap, etc)</li>
<LI>Female education</li>
<LI>Women empowerment (Economic, Political etc)</li>
<LI>Hazards of early sex (teenage pregnancy STD'S HIV\AIDS, etc)</li>
<LI>Drug abuse</li>
<LI>Bush fire</li></ul>
