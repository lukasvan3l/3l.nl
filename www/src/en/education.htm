<p class=head2><u><B>History</b></u></p>
Nana had begun with a tailoring school and a soap making facility. They were built to help disabled people and streetchildren to get a job.<br>
But that was not the root of the problem. That is how Nana got the idea to start a school for orphans in Sekyere and surrounding villages. The school was set up to provide the children with a better future. <br>
To support Nana's project, the community made the local postoffice available for Nana to put a school in. He started with about 20 children. But because he did not ask money from the children, more and more people got interested int he school. Momentarily there are about 120 children, of which 30 are orphans.<br>
To support this number of students, the school needed a new location. The SRC is now putting all its effort in building a school that supports this many students. You can see pictures of the new school building by clicking <a href=../foto/school.htm>here</a>.

The Van Driel Preperatory School has built a reputation of good education and skillful teachers. This reputation is good for the school, because it attracts even more teachers. Also, there are always 2 European volunteers that teach the children.
